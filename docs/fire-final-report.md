## 1. Introduction 
- *Include your language white paper.*

F.I.R.E (File Input Reinterpretation Engine) is a programming language inspired by AWK, Bash & C. It seeks to provide some of the robust pattern matching and script-manipulation functionality of these languages with a more palatable syntax.

### 1.1 Motivation

AWK & Bash remain essential weapons in the arsenal of any programmer seeking to manipulate text files in a Unix-like environment. They are robust and integrate well with other Unix tools, but they are also artifacts of a time before the total dominance of C in the landscape of programming language design. As a result, both languages feature syntax that is downright alien to generations of programmers reared on C and C-like languages like Java, C++, Python and et al. Bash, for all its utility, has gained a reputation for fiddly and non-intuitive syntax rules (ever leave an extraneous space in a `makefile` or `.bashrc`? You know what I'm talking about). 

Since C is so well regarded and so well know, we have made

## 2. Tutorial
- *A short explanation telling a novice how to use your language.*

## 3. Language Reference Manual 
 - *Include your language reference manual.*

## 4. Project Plan
 - *Identify process used for planning, specification, development and testing*
- *Include a one-page programming style guide used by the team*
- *Show your project timeline*
- *Identify roles and responsibilities of each team member*
- *Describe the software development environment used (tools and languages)
Include your project log*

## 5. Architectural Design 
- *Give block diagram showing the major components of your translator*
- *Describe the interfaces between the components*
- *State who implemented each component*

## 6. Testing Plan
- *Show two or three representative source language programs along with the target language program generated for each*
- *Show the test suites used to test your translator*
- *Explain why and how these test cases were chosen*
- *What kind of automation was used in testing*
- *State who did what*

## 7. Lessons Learned
- *Each team member should explain his or her most important learning
Include any advice the team has for future teams*

## 8. Appendix
- *Attach a complete code listing of your translator with each module signed by its author*
