## Meeting with John

1. Add defaults to slicing operator on arrays.
		* Drop the stride maybe?
1. statically typed regular expressions, ie there needs to be a type for regex
1. Checkout Golang for the example of iterating over our Associative array:
		* `int i, string j := arr { ... }` is an example of this
1. Our declaration of associative arrays will look like:
		* `array arr[<type key>,<type val>];`
1. Expose a fold (left implicitly) function to the user, then use that functionality to implement a `Map` and `filter` build in operation
1. Define the single function primitive for storage of signature etc...
1. Should we change our filetype to `filer` and `filew` for read and write files? Or should we have the mode as a param on the initialization of the type?

## To do

Graham is going to make a PR with the stubbed out markdown files for each of our
data types. In that markdown file, we'll define explicitly the semantics of that
particular type. This will be the skeleton of our LRM and help us start to get
content that we can iterate on.

### Deliverable for October 9
