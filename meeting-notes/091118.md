## things we like

1. Expressing and assigning at the same time
1. arrow functions like in js
```javscript
		(paramters) => {

		}
```
1. white space shouldn't matter at all
1. synchronous programming
1. a language that helps manipulating files, like the `cut`, `grep`, etc
		* the language could have built in keywords like `cut` that would return
		a space delimited array of strings
		* cat operators like `>>` and `>`
1. maybe we have a `file` type, that just opens a file for you
1. we like the idea of allowing for slicing, like in Python. Maybe our language supports a flipping columns of the `file` like:
```
f = file();
column1 = f[::1]
```

## our language
